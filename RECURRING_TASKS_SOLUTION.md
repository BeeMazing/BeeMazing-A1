# Recurring Tasks Management Solution

## Overview

This document describes the new recurring task management system that allows for granular control over individual task occurrences, addressing the previous limitation where deleting or editing a task would affect all past and future occurrences.

## Problem Solved

**Previous Issue**: When a recurring task was deleted or edited, the entire task record was removed/modified, affecting all past and future occurrences of that task.

**Solution**: Implemented a task exception system that allows:
1. Deleting specific task occurrences without affecting others
2. Editing specific task occurrences 
3. Editing tasks from a specific date forward (splitting recurring tasks)
4. Maintaining full edit capabilities for entire task series

## New Features

### 1. Task Exception System

Tasks now support an `exceptions` field that stores modifications for specific dates:

```javascript
{
  title: "Daily Cleanup",
  date: "2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31",
  repeat: "Daily",
  users: ["Alice", "Bob"],
  exceptions: {
    "2024-03-15": { deleted: true },
    "2024-03-20": { 
      modified: true,
      task: {
        title: "Special Cleanup",
        users: ["Charlie"],
        reward: "10"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. User Interface Enhancements

#### New Task Detail Modal Options

When viewing a task, users now see four action buttons:

1. **Edit This Occurrence** - Modify only the selected date
2. **Edit Future Occurrences** - Split the task and modify from selected date forward
3. **Delete This Occurrence** - Remove only the selected date occurrence
4. **Edit Entire Task** - Original functionality for full task editing

#### Visual Indicators

- Modified task occurrences show a "üìù Modified" indicator
- Form notices indicate when editing single occurrences vs future occurrences
- Confirmation dialogs clarify the scope of delete operations

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoints

#### 1. Delete Single Occurrence
```
DELETE /api/tasks/occurrence
Parameters: adminEmail, title, date, originalStartDate
```
Creates a deletion exception for the specific date instead of removing the entire task.

#### 2. Edit Single Occurrence
```
PUT /api/tasks/occurrence
Body: { adminEmail, originalTitle, originalStartDate, targetDate, modifiedTask }
```
Creates a modification exception for the specific date with the new task properties.

#### 3. Edit Future Occurrences
```
PUT /api/tasks/future
Body: { adminEmail, originalTitle, originalStartDate, splitDate, modifiedTask }
```
Splits the recurring task:
- Original task ends the day before split date
- New task starts from split date with modified properties

### Frontend Changes

#### Task Filtering Logic (`taskrotations.js`)

Enhanced `filterTasksForDate()` function to:
- Check for deletion exceptions and exclude those dates
- Apply modification exceptions by returning modified task properties
- Maintain original task reference for proper data handling

#### Task Detail Modal (`tasks.html`)

Updated `showTaskDetails()` function with:
- New button options for different edit types
- localStorage-based communication with addtasks.html
- Proper date context passing

#### Task Creation/Editing (`addtasks.html`)

Enhanced form handling to:
- Detect edit mode type from localStorage
- Show appropriate notices for edit scope
- Route to correct backend endpoints based on edit type
- Handle special date constraints for single/future edits

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Delete Single Occurrence

User wants to delete "Daily Cleanup" for March 15th only:

1. Click on task on March 15th
2. Click "Delete This Occurrence"
3. Confirm deletion for specific date
4. Task appears normally on all other dates

**Result**: Exception added: `"2024-03-15": { deleted: true }`

### Scenario 2: Edit Single Occurrence

User wants to change "Daily Cleanup" to "Special Event Cleanup" on March 20th:

1. Click on task on March 20th
2. Click "Edit This Occurrence"
3. Modify task properties in form
4. Save changes

**Result**: Exception added with modified task properties

### Scenario 3: Edit Future Occurrences

User wants to add a reward to "Daily Cleanup" starting April 1st:

1. Click on task on April 1st
2. Click "Edit Future Occurrences"
3. Add reward in form
4. Save changes

**Result**: 
- Original task ends March 31st
- New task starts April 1st with reward

## Data Migration

Existing tasks continue to work normally. The exception system is additive - tasks without exceptions behave exactly as before.

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if taskrotations.js fails to load
- Retry logic for network requests
- Clear error messages for invalid operations
- Validation of edit mode parameters

## Browser Compatibility

- Uses modern JavaScript features (async/await, destructuring)
- Falls back gracefully for older browsers
- localStorage used for cross-page communication

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple dates for batch modifications
2. **Template System**: Save modified occurrences as templates
3. **History Tracking**: View change history for task occurrences
4. **Recurring Exceptions**: Create patterns for regular exceptions
5. **Import/Export**: Backup and restore task exception data

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. Create daily recurring task
2. Delete single occurrence and verify other dates unaffected
3. Edit single occurrence and verify modification appears correctly
4. Edit future occurrences and verify task splitting
5. Verify visual indicators display properly
6. Test edge cases (first/last dates, overlapping ranges)

### Data Integrity Checks

1. Verify original tasks remain unchanged when using exceptions
2. Confirm exception data structure is valid
3. Test with various repeat patterns (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
4. Validate date parsing and timezone handling

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Task not updating**: Check browser console for network errors
2. **Modal not appearing**: Verify selected date is properly set
3. **Edit mode not detected**: Clear localStorage and try again
4. **Exception not applying**: Check date format consistency

### Debug Information

Enable detailed logging by checking browser console for:
- Task filtering operations
- Exception processing
- Network request/response data
- Edit mode detection

### Recovery Procedures

If exceptions cause issues:
1. Individual exceptions can be removed from database
2. Tasks can be reverted to original state
3. Full task deletion still available as fallback
