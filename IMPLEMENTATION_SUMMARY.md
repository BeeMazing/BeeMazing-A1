# Recurring Tasks Management - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: When deleting or editing recurring tasks, all past and future occurrences were affected because the system would delete/modify the entire task record.

**Solution Implemented**: A granular task exception system that allows users to:
- Delete specific task occurrences without affecting others
- Edit specific task occurrences for individual dates
- Edit tasks from a specific date forward (task splitting)
- Maintain full control over entire task series

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`server.js`)

#### New API Endpoints

1. **Delete Single Occurrence**
   ```
   DELETE /api/tasks/occurrence
   Query Parameters: adminEmail, title, date, originalStartDate
   ```
   - Creates a deletion exception instead of removing entire task
   - Adds `"YYYY-MM-DD": { deleted: true }` to task's exceptions field

2. **Edit Single Occurrence**
   ```
   PUT /api/tasks/occurrence
   Body: { adminEmail, originalTitle, originalStartDate, targetDate, modifiedTask }
   ```
   - Creates a modification exception for specific date
   - Stores modified task properties in exceptions field

3. **Edit Future Occurrences**
   ```
   PUT /api/tasks/future
   Body: { adminEmail, originalTitle, originalStartDate, splitDate, modifiedTask }
   ```
   - Splits recurring task at specified date
   - Original task ends day before split date
   - New task starts from split date with modified properties

### Data Structure Enhancement

Tasks now support an `exceptions` field:
```javascript
{
  title: "Daily Cleanup",
  date: "2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31",
  repeat: "Daily",
  users: ["Alice", "Bob"],
  exceptions: {
    "2024-03-15": { deleted: true },
    "2024-03-20": { 
      modified: true,
      task: {
        title: "Special Cleanup",
        users: ["Charlie"],
        reward: "10"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### Task Filtering Logic (`taskrotations.js`)

Enhanced `filterTasksForDate()` function:
- **Line 32-46**: Added exception checking logic
- **Line 146-162**: Added task modification mapping
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing tasks

#### User Interface (`tasks.html`)

Updated `showTaskDetails()` function:
- **Line 906-912**: Added four new action buttons
- **Line 924-968**: Added event handlers for new editing modes
- **Line 1094-1146**: Added `deleteSingleOccurrence()` function

#### Task Creation/Editing (`addtasks.html`)

Enhanced form handling:
- **Line 1032-1067**: Added detection for new editing modes
- **Line 1162-1227**: Added special form handling for occurrence/future edits
- **Line 2169-2245**: Updated save logic to route to appropriate endpoints

#### Visual Enhancements

- **Modified Task Indicator**: Tasks show "üìù Modified" when edited for specific dates
- **Edit Mode Notices**: Form displays colored notices indicating edit scope
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Clear messaging about operation scope

## üé® User Experience

### New Task Detail Modal Options

When users click on a recurring task, they see four buttons:

1. **Edit This Occurrence** (Blue) - Modifies only the selected date
2. **Edit Future Occurrences** (Green) - Splits task and modifies from selected date forward
3. **Delete This Occurrence** (Red) - Removes only the selected date occurrence
4. **Edit Entire Task** (Gray) - Original functionality for full task editing

### Visual Feedback

- Modified occurrences show a yellow "üìù Modified" indicator
- Form notices use color coding:
  - Yellow: Single occurrence editing
  - Blue: Future occurrences editing
- Delete confirmations specify scope of operation

## üìã Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Delete Single Occurrence
```
User Action: Delete "Daily Cleanup" on March 15th only
Result: Exception added: "2024-03-15": { deleted: true }
Effect: Task hidden on March 15th, appears normally on all other dates
```

### Scenario 2: Edit Single Occurrence
```
User Action: Change "Daily Cleanup" to "Party Cleanup" on March 20th
Result: Exception with modified task properties
Effect: Shows "Party Cleanup" on March 20th, "Daily Cleanup" on other dates
```

### Scenario 3: Edit Future Occurrences
```
User Action: Add reward to "Daily Cleanup" starting April 1st
Result: Original task ends March 31st, new task starts April 1st with reward
Effect: No reward before April 1st, reward added from April 1st onwards
```

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Delete Single Occurrence
1. User clicks "Delete This Occurrence" on specific date
2. Frontend calls `DELETE /api/tasks/occurrence`
3. Backend adds deletion exception to task
4. Frontend reloads tasks for date
5. Filtering logic excludes task for that date only

### Edit Single Occurrence
1. User clicks "Edit This Occurrence"
2. Form opens with `isOccurrenceEdit = true`
3. User modifies task properties
4. Frontend calls `PUT /api/tasks/occurrence`
5. Backend adds modification exception
6. Filtering logic applies modified properties for that date

### Edit Future Occurrences
1. User clicks "Edit Future Occurrences"
2. Form opens with `isFutureEdit = true`
3. User modifies task properties
4. Frontend calls `PUT /api/tasks/future`
5. Backend splits task at specified date
6. Two separate task records exist

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Test Cases

1. **Create Recurring Task**: Daily task from Jan 1 to Dec 31
2. **Delete Single Occurrence**: Delete March 15th, verify other dates unaffected
3. **Edit Single Occurrence**: Modify March 20th, verify original task unchanged
4. **Edit Future Occurrences**: Split at April 1st, verify two task records
5. **Visual Indicators**: Confirm modified tasks show indicator
6. **Edge Cases**: Test first/last dates, overlapping ranges

### Data Integrity Verification

- Original tasks remain unchanged when using exceptions
- Exception data structure follows defined schema
- Date parsing handles timezones correctly
- Filtering logic processes exceptions in correct order

## üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Retry logic with 2 attempts, 90-second timeout
- **Invalid Data**: Validation of edit mode parameters
- **Missing Functions**: Graceful fallback if taskrotations.js fails
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for failed operations

## üìä Performance Impact

- **Minimal Database Changes**: Exceptions stored within existing task documents
- **Efficient Filtering**: Exception checking adds minimal processing overhead
- **Memory Usage**: Slight increase for tasks with many exceptions
- **Network Traffic**: Similar to existing operations

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified for future versions:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple dates for batch modifications
2. **Exception Templates**: Save and reuse common modifications
3. **History Tracking**: View change history for task occurrences
4. **Recurring Exceptions**: Create patterns for regular exceptions (e.g., skip all Sundays)
5. **Import/Export**: Backup and restore task exception data
6. **Advanced UI**: Calendar view showing exceptions at a glance

## üîí Backward Compatibility

- **Existing Tasks**: Continue to work exactly as before
- **No Migration Required**: Exception system is purely additive
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tasks without exceptions behave identically to original system
- **API Compatibility**: Original endpoints remain unchanged
